# Reinforcement-learning
In this repository I explore Reinforcement Learning for solving basic task.
It is divided in three notebooks, in the first I tune parameters and try
to speed-up learning convergence for the CartPole. In the second I learn to control the
CartPole environment using directly the screen pixels, this require more work and I decide
to implement double and a dueling double DQN. In the third i explore the MontainCar gym environment.
